def nqueens(n):
    """
    Solves the n-queens puzzle for a given board size n.
    The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n√ón chessboard
    so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two
    queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

    Args:
        n (int): Size of the chess board and number of queens to place

    Returns:
        list or False: A list representing the row positions for each queen (indexed by column),
                      or False if no solution exists

    Example:
        nqueens(4) returns [1, 3, 0, 2] representing a valid solution where:
        - Queen in column 0 is in row 1
        - Queen in column 1 is in row 3
        - Queen in column 2 is in row 0
        - Queen in column 3 is in row 2
